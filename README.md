The School Management API is a Node.js and Express-based application that allows users to manage school data efficiently. It includes two key functionalities: adding new schools and retrieving a list of schools based on proximity. The **Add School API** (`POST /addSchool`) accepts details like name, address, latitude, and longitude, validates the input, and stores the data in a MySQL database. The **List Schools API** (`GET /listSchools`) fetches all schools and sorts them by their distance from a user-specified location using the Haversine formula. This API is ideal for applications requiring location-based sorting and efficient school data management.
